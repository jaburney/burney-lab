    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Yan Jiang (蒋颜)</h3>
    <p><strong>Visiting Postdoctoral Scholar</strong></p>
    <p>Yan Jiang is a Hydroclimate Scientist who uses satellite remote sensing, climate/physical models, and advanced statistical/AI techniques to quantify agricultural vulnerability and improve the resilience of global water systems. She is currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC San Diego (School of Global Policy and Strategy & Scripps Institution of Oceanography). She completed her degrees in Atmospheric Science from UAlbany, SUNY (Ph.D.) and Sun Yat-Sen University (B.S.). When she's not tracking rainfall, you might find her chasing her doggie, Lily, "swagging" in a bubble tea store or Trader Joe's, or struggling to find her way down a hiking or ski trail.</p>
