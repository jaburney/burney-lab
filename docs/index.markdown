<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
Our group is focused on understanding emissions from agriculture and land use change, characterizing climate and air pollution risks to food security, and helping farmers and food systems adapt to environmental changes. We are particularly interested in the role that short-lived climate pollutants play in this coupled system; and in designing robust public policy around seasonal and sub-seasonal hydroclimate variability in a warming world. We use methods from physics, statistics, and policy analysis and work with data and on the ground.
