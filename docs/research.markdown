Climate and food security are deeply intertwined: (1) Every human needs food to survive; nearly 1 in 8 don't have enough to eat on a daily basis. (2) No sector is more exposed than agriculture to climate variability and climate change; shifts in the physical environment over the past several decades have made it harder to produce enough food for the planet. (3) Agricultural production, biomass burning, and cropland expansion into forests and savannas are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutants, and other forms of environmental degradation; many of agriculture's most damaging impacts are driven by poverty and food insecurity.

We start from the basic physics governing earth's climate and characterize fundamental constraints posed by both natural variability and climate changes to food availability and access. We then use that information to design and test technologies, policies, and strategies for nourishing, climate-adapted food systems around the world. Finally, with detailed measurement and attribution of food systems emissions, we are working to understand the fundamental limits of – and pathways towards – a zero emissions and zero hunger world.

Below please find some examples of major projects we are working on right now (to be updated with links and more detailed descriptions shortly):

- Seasonal and subseasonal crop hydroclimate variability and shifts and their impacts
- Air pollution impacts on global and regional food production
- Solar food dryers, irrigation, and other adaptation technologies and strategies
- Climate resilient school feeding programs
- Re-thinking the food social safety net in a warming world
- Net zero emissions food systems
- Impacts of aerosol emissions from food systems – including links to human health and disease (Kawasaki disease)
